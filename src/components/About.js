        <h3>However, in this day of the internet and its fad diets and exercise regimes, quick-fixes, and instant gratifation, we have lost sight of what it means to listen to our bodies, to commit to a long-term goal of bettering yourself.</h3>
        <h3>We are here to help you get back on track to finding balance within and among your phyisical, mental, and emotional states of wellbeing.</h3>
        <h3>Our note-taking app is not simply for jotting down a grocery lsit or a phone number you need to remember for later. It is about checking in with yourself daily on your emotional and physical state, recording changes and fluctuations, and ensuring balance is maintained. It is an active proccess.</h3>
        <h3>It is a life-long endeavor filled with ups and downs. But finding farmony within all three of these areas of your life is the first step to a beautiful existence.</h3>
